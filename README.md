### General Info
***
In this case study I am going to analyze data from FitBit users, which is a personal health tracker. The objective is to gain insights from FitBit secondary data, to drive business decisions for another health tracker company called BellaBeat. This data analysis can help guide BellaBeat's marketing strategies, particularly for two of their products Leaf (tracker bracelet) and Time (wellness watch). Some instructions were provided by Google Data Analytics, which is a course on Cursera, developed by Google.

**Deliverables**

1. A clear summary of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis

**Questions to address**

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to BellaBeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence BellaBeat marketing strategy?
